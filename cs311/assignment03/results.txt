# Activity Selection Problem

## Methodology

The method that I used to calculate the performance of the three different
algorithms was quite simple. I made use of the function `System.nanoTime()` to
get the nano seconds. By calling it before and after the method and taking the
difference of each result, I was able to determine the nano seconds that it
took for the method to run.

    Note: Have a look at the Runner.java class to see the code that I used to
    generate these results.

To ensure that the times I gathered weren't affected by OS scheduling or
anything else, I ran each test 10,000 times and averaged the results each time.

For each one of the 10,000 rounds, I would generate a random set of n
intervals, where n was a power of 2. Each scheduler would then run on this
random set of intervals.

## Expectations

Based on Big-Oh analysis, each of the brute force schedulers is expected to run
in O(2^n) time. This is because each subset needs to be checked. Even though
the smart brute force scheduler tries to do it intelligently, it still
evaluates to O(2^n) for the average case.

The Big-Oh analysis for the Earliest Deadline algorithm is O(n). This is because
Earliest greedily selects the best possible interval based on the ending times. A
proof of this greediness can be constructed like here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_selection_problem#Proof_of_optimality

Based on this analysis, we can expect the time for input sizes n and 2n to grow
exponentially for the brute force methods.

However, for the greedy method, the time for input of size n and 2n should only
double, indicating a linear growth rate.

## Results

The results for the analysis are in the table below. The first column indicates
the size of the input. The next three columns indicate the scheduler used to
determine the optimal set. The last three columns take the time for input size
n and divides it by the time it took for input size (n / 2).

By dividing the time by the previous time, we can see what happens everytime
the input size of n is doubled.

## Conclusion

As the results show, both brute force schedulers grow exponentially when the
input size is doubled. Yet the greedy scheduler approximately doubles with the
input size. This is exactly what the Big Oh analysis predicted.

Thus it shows that Big Oh is a very valid way for comparing runtime of
algorithms.

The power of asymptotics is great =D
