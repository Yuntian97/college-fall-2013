\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Prove or disprove: P \(\subseteq\) NP
    \\

    \solution

    \begin{proof}
        To prove that P \(\subseteq\) NP, lets first look at what it means to
        be in P.
        \\

        A given problem \(A\) is in P if it can be solved/decided in
        polynomial time. A given problem is in NP if it can be verified by
        a verifier in polynomial time.
        \\

        Let \(A\) be a problem in P. This means that \(A\) can be solved by
        an algorithm in polynomial time.
        \\

        Thus given a certificate \(c\) that is a solution to \(A\), it easily follows
        that \(c\) can be verified to be a solution to \(A\) because \(c\) was originally
        found in polynomial time because \(A\) is in P.
        \\

        Thus since \(A\) can be verified in polynomial time by such a verifier,
        it proves that \(A\) is also in NP. This shows that \(P \subseteq
        NP\) and thus concludes the proof.
    \end{proof}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Consider the Hitting Set problem which is defined as:
    \\

    \textsc{\bfseries Hitting Set}
    \begin{algorithm}[]
        \begin{algorithmic}[1]
            \Require A collection \(C\) of subsets of a set \(S\), a positive integer \(k\).

            \Ensure Does \(S\) contain a subset \(S'\) such that \(\left\vert
            S' \right\vert \leq k\) and each subset in \(C\) contains one
            element from \(S'\)?
        \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}

    \textbf{Part A}

    Prove that Hitting Set \(in\) NP.

    \begin{proof}
        To prove that Hitting set in NP, we must prove that there exists a
        verifier such that given a valid certificate \(c\), it can be verified
        in polynomial time.
        \\

        Let \(V\) be such a verifier for the Hitting Set:
        \\

        \(V = \)`` On input \(\langle \langle C, k \rangle, c \rangle\):
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{proof}

    \textbf{Part B}

    Prove that Hitting Set is hard for NP.

    \begin{proof}
    \end{proof}

    \textbf{Part C}

    Prove that Hitting Set is complete for NP.

    \begin{proof}
        The qualifications for being NP-complete are the following:

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item The problem is in NP.
            \item And that every \(A\) in NP is polynomial time reducible to
                the problem. Or we can show that a problem already known to be
                in NP-complete can be polynomially reduced to the problem.
        \end{enumerate}

        The thing to note is that the second item is also the qualifying
        statement to be NP-hard.
        \\

        Considering the above note, the first part was solved in \textbf{Part
        A}, and the second part was solved in \textbf{Part B}, by definition
        this means that the Hitting Set problem is in NP-complete and we
        conclude the proof.

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Show that the following problem is NP-complete.
    \\

    \textsc{\bfseries Dense Subgraph}
    \begin{algorithm}[]
        \begin{algorithmic}[1]
            \Require A graph \(G\) and integers \(k\) and \(y\).

            \Ensure Does \(G\) contain a subgraph with exactly \(k\) vertices
            and at least \(y\) edges?
        \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}

    \solution

    \begin{proof}
        To prove that the Dense Subgraph problem is in NP-complete, we must
        first show the following:

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Dense Subgraph is in NP.
            \item And that every \(A\) in NP is polynomial time reducible
                to Dense Subgraph. Or we can show that a problem already known
                to be in NP-complete can be polynomially reduced to Dense
                Subgraph.
        \end{enumerate}

        \textbf{Part One}

        First let's show that Dense Subgraph is in NP. To prove that Dense
        Subgraph is in NP, we must prove that there exists a verifier such
        that given a valid certificate \(c\), it can be verified
        in polynomial time.
        \\

        Let \(V\) be such a verifier for Dense Subgraph where \(c\) is a valid
        certificate thus a subgraph:
        \\

        \(V = \)`` On input \(\langle \langle G, k, y \rangle, c \rangle\):
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Decode the certificate \(c\) into a new graph, \(G'\).
            \item Test that all nodes and edges in \(G'\) are in \(G\).
            \item Count up the number of vertices in \(G'\) and check that
                it equals \(k\).
            \item Count up the number of edges in \(G'\) and check that
                it equals \(y\).
            \item If everything checks out, \(accept\), else \(reject\).''
        \end{enumerate}

        The verifier \(V\) thus runs in time less than \(O(V + E)\) where \(V =
        \left\vert G.vertices \right\vert\) and \(E = \left\vert G.edges
        \right\vert\) because \(G'\) is a subgraph of \(G\). Since the verifier
        runs in polynomial time, Dense Subgraph is in NP.
        \\

        \textbf{Part Two}

        Second we must show that a problem already in NP-complete is
        polynomially reducible to Dense Subgraph.
        \\

        Let us conside the \(CLIQUE\) problem, which tells us whether or not
        there is a subgraph where every node in the subgraph is connected to
        each other in the subgraph.
        \\

        Let \(M\) be a Turing machine that solves the \(CLIQUE\) problem. We can
        then reduce \(CLIQUE\) to the Dense Subgraph, \(CLIQUE \leq_p\) Dense
        Subgraph problem by constructing a new Turing machine called \(N\) that
        is constructed as follows:

        \(N = \)`` On input string \(\langle G, k, y \rangle\) where \(G\) is a graph and \(s\) and \(t\) are vertices:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Blah
        \end{enumerate}

    \end{proof}
\end{homeworkProblem}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Show that the following problem is NP-complete:
    \\

    \textsc{\bfseries Longest Path}
    \begin{algorithm}[]
        \begin{algorithmic}[1]
            \Require A graph \(G\) and positive integer \(k\).

            \Ensure Does \(G\) contain a path that visits at least \(k\)
            different vertices without visiting any vertex more than once?
        \end{algorithmic}
    \end{algorithm}

    \solution
        To prove that the Longest Path problem is in NP-complete, we must first
        show the following:

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Longest Path Subgraph is in NP.
            \item That a problem already known to be in NP-complete can be
                polynomially reducible to Longest Path.
        \end{enumerate}

    \begin{proof}
    \end{proof}
\end{homeworkProblem}

\pagebreak

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Why doesn't the following algorithm suffice to prove it is in P, since it
    runs in \(O(n)\) time?

    \begin{algorithm}[]
        \begin{algorithmic}[1]
            \Function{PrimalityTesting}{$n$}
                \State{} $composite \gets false$
                \\
                \ForAll{$i \in 2 \ldots n - 1$}
                    \If{$n \bmod i = 0$}
                        \State{} $composite \gets true$
                    \EndIf
                \EndFor
                \\
                \State{} \Return{$composite$}
            \EndFunction{}
        \end{algorithmic}
        \caption{Simple primality test}
    \end{algorithm}

    \solution

    This is a common mistake when first learning about the complexity classes.
    The reason is that \alg{PrimalityTesting($n$)}, actually \textit{doesn't}
    run in polynomial time, or \(O(n)\).
    \\

    The reason for this is because in order for it to be in P, it must run in
    polynomial time with respect to the \textit{length} of \(n\), not the
    value.
    \\

    Thus the actual length of \(n\), let this be \(n_0\), is actually \(n_0 = 1
    + \log_{10} n\) for any positive integer \(n\). Thus in order for
    \alg{PrimalityTesting($n$)} to run in polynomial time, it must run in
    \(O(n_0) = O(\log n)\) time if \(n\) is the number to check.
