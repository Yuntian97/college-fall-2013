\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Using a loop invariant, prove that the following property holds for
    \(MAX\):

    \[
        \forall{0 \leq i < n},\ list[i] \leq MAX(list)
    \]

    \textbf{Solution}

    \begin{proof}
        To prove the following property holds, we will use the following loop
        invariant:
        \\

        \begin{adjustwidth}{2.5em}{0pt}
            When looping, of all of the elements in the range \(list[0 \hdots
            i]\), \(maxValue\) will contain the the value that is the largest
            element in the range of elements.
            \\
        \end{adjustwidth}

        By proving the loop invariant, it will prove the correctness of
        the function \(MAX(list)\). Thus the property will hold.
        \\

        \textbf{Initialization}

        At the beginning of the loop, \(i = 0\). Since \(maxValue = list[0]\),
        there is only one value in the range of elements. It is trivially true
        that the max value of a range with 1 element is always that element.
        Thus the the loop invariant holds.
        \\

        \textbf{Maintenance}

        During each iteration of the while loop on line 3, the value of
        \(list[i]\) is compared to \(maxValue\). If \(list[i] > maxValue\),
        then \(maxValue = list[i]\).
        \\

        Since this happens each loop of the iteration, everytime \(i\) is
        incremented on line 7, the range of elements consists of \(list[0
        \hdots i]\). Thus since \(i\) is being incremented by one, the range is
        growing by one everytime. Since \(maxValue\) is the largest element in
        the range \(list[0 \hdots i - 1]\), we just need to compare the value
        at \(list[i]\) to see if we need to update \(maxValue\).
        \\

        This is exactly what the loop invariant says, thus it proves the
        maintenance step of the loop invariant.
        \\

        \textbf{Termination}

        When the loop terminates, it terminates when \(i < n\). Since \(i\) is incremented
        every iteration in the while loop on line 7, when \(i = n\) the loop will stop.
        \\

        Since \(n\) is the length of the array, it is easy to tell that when
        \(i = n\), all items in \(list\) have been iterated over and thus
        \(maxValue\) will be set to the maximum value in the whole array from
        lines 4--5.
        \\

        Since this corresponds to the termination step of the loop invariant,
        it is easy to see that the loop invariant holds.
    \end{proof}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Prove that a tree with \(n\) vertices has precisely \(n - 1\) edges.

    \begin{proof}
        To prove that a tree with \(n\) vertices has precisely \(n - 1\) edges, we will use induction.
        \\

        \textbf{Base}

        First consider the simplest possible tree, a tree with
        \(n = 0\) vertices.  Since the tree consists of just one vertex, there
        are no edges to other vertices and a tree cannot have a cycle. The
        number of edges is \(0\) or \(n - 1 = 0\). Thus it holds for the base
        case.
        \\

        \textbf{Step}

        We want to prove that for a tree with \(n + 1\) vertices, the tree will
        also have \((n + 1) - 1\) edges.
        \\

        Consider a tree, \(T_0\) with \(n\) vertices. We can create a new tree,
        \(T\) by taking \(T_0\) and adding one vertex to it. This would give \(n + 1\)
        vertices. Because we'd need to connect the vertice to \(T_0\), the
        number of edges would then be:

        \[
            \mbox{edges} = T + 1
        \]

        We know this because a tree must be connected and have no cycles. By
        assuming the induction hypothesis:

        \[
            \begin{split}
                \mbox{edges} &= T + 1
                \\
                &= (n - 1) + 1
                \\
                &= (n + 1) - 1
            \end{split}
        \]

        Thus we have shown that a tree with \(n + 1\) vertices has exactly \((n
        + 1) - 1\) edges.
    \end{proof}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Prove that \(6n^4 + 2n^3 + n + 12 \in \Theta(n^4)\).

    \begin{proof}
        To prove that \(6n^4 + 2n^3 + n + 12 \in \Theta(n^4)\), we must show
        the following:

        \[
            \exists c_1 \exists c_2 \forall n \geq n_0,\ {c_1 \cdot g(n) \leq
            f(n) \leq c_2 \cdot g(n)}
        \]

        For the first equality, it is easy to see that \(n^4 \leq c_1 \cdot
        (6n^4 + 2n^3 + n + 12)\) even for \(c_1 = 1\) and \(n_0 = 1\).
        \\

        Now we must show the second part of the equality:

        \[
            \begin{split}
                6n^4 + 2n^3 + n + 12 &=
                \\
                &\leq 6n^4 + 2n^4 + n^4 + 12n^4
                \\
                &= 24n^4
                \\
                &\leq c_2 \cdot n^4
            \end{split}
        \]

        when \(c_2 = 24\) and \(n_0 = 1\).
        \\

        Therefore, since we have found our two constants, \(c_1 = 1\) and \(c_2
        = 24\), and constrained \(n_0 = 1\), we have proven the proposition.
        Thus the proof is complete.

    \begin{proof}
        \[
            \exists c_1 \exists c_2 \forall n \geq n_0,\ {c_1 \cdot g(n) \leq
            f(n) \leq c_2 \cdot g(n)}

\begin{homeworkProblem}
    Give an appropriate positive constant \(c\) such that \(f(n) \leq c \cdot
    g(n)\) for all \(n > 1\).

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \(f(n) = n^2 + n + 1\), \(g(n) = 2n^3\)
        \item \(f(n) = n\sqrt{n} + n^2\), \(g(n) = n^2\)
        \item \(f(n) = n^2 - n + 1\), \(g(n) = n^2 / 2\)
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Solution}

    We solve each solution algebraically to determine a possible constant
    \(c\).
    \\

    \textbf{Part One}

    \[
        \begin{split}
            n^2 + n + 1 &=
            \\
            &\leq n^2 + n^2 + n^2
            \\
            &= 3n^2
            \\
            &\leq c \cdot 2n^3
        \end{split}
    \]

    Thus a valid \(c\) could be when \(c = 2\).
    \\

    \textbf{Part Two}

    \[
        \begin{split}
            n^2 + n\sqrt{n} &=
            \\
            &= n^2 + n^{3/2}
            \\
            &\leq n^2 + n^{4/2}
            \\
            &= n^2 + n^2
            \\
            &= 2n^2
            \\
            &\leq c \cdot n^2
        \end{split}
    \]

    Thus a valid \(c\) is \(c = 2\).
    \\

    \textbf{Part Three}

    \[
        \begin{split}
            n^2 - n + 1 &=
            \\
            &\leq n^2
            \\
            &\leq c \cdot n^2/2
        \end{split}
    \]

    Thus a valid \(c\) is \(c = 2\).
