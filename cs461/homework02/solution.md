## Question 1

Which of the following dependencies can you infer do not hold over schema S?
    - A -> B:
    - BC -> A:
    - B -> C:

Can you identify any dependencies that hold over S?
    - No. In order to say that a dependency holds over a given schema, we would
      need to ensure it holds for all instances of the relation.

## Question 2

Is D1 = {ABC, ACDE, ADG} a lossless join decomposition?

Is D1 a dependency-preserving decomposition?

What is the strongest normal form of ABC and why?

## Question 3

Is D2 a dependency-preserving decomposition? Why?

Is D2 a lossless-join decomposition? Why?
