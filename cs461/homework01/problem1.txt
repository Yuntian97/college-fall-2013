Extra Info

Course
    - Since Courses can be cross listed, there is no key constraint. It does
      have a total constraint because a course shouldn't exist without a
      Department.

Student
    - First name and last name are broken up for searching
    - Each Student *requires* a Major, thus total and key constraint
    - Students can have a Minor, but only one, so therefore there is a key
      constraint
    - Each Student can have two addresses, one permanent and one current

Address
    - An Address is a weak entity because it cannot exist without a Student
      living at it either permanently or currently
    - There is no key constraint because a Student could have the same permanent
      and current Address.
    - Each Student must at least have a permanent Address, thus the total
      constraint.

Department
    - No constraints.

Section
    - A Section is a weak entity to the Teaching relationship because a section
      should only exist if it has all required information assigned to it

Grade
    - A relationship because it is assigned to a Student and his/her
      corresponding Section.
    - A Student cannot have multiple grades per section, thus a key constraint
      is used.
    - A total constraint is not used because at the beginning of the semester
      students don't have a grade. It would only be issued at Midterm/Finals.
